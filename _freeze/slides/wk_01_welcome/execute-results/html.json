You'll also be able to note\n    this in the Getting to know you survey.\n-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your\n    experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with\n    me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone\n    outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.\n-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse\n    perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone)\n    that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.\n:::\n\n## Accessibility\n\n-   The [Student Disability Access Office\n    (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that\n    students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.\n\n-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm always\n    learning how to do this better. If any course component is not accessible\n    to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n\n# Pour terminer\n\n## COVID\n\n-   Il est toujours recommand√© de porter un masque en tout temps √† l'int√©rieur!\n\n-   Vous √™tes libres de faire vos propres choix.\n\n## Collaboration policy\n\n-   Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed\n    collaboratively.\n\n-   Homeworks must be completed individually. You may **not** directly share\n    answers / code with others, however you are welcome to discuss the problems\n    in general and ask for advice.\n\n-   Exams must be completed individually. You may **not** discuss any aspect of\n    the exam with peers. If you have questions, post as private questions on\n    the course forum, only the teaching team will see and answer.\n\n## Sharing / reusing code policy\n\n-   We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many\n    tasks may have solutions posted\n\n-   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may\n    make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow,\n    etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly\n    use or use as inspiration in your solution(s).\n\n-   Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be\n    treated as plagiarism, regardless of source\n\n## Most importantly!\n\nAsk if you're not sure if something violates a policy!\n\n# Making STA 210 a success\n\n## Five tips for success\n\n1.  Complete all the preparation work before class.\n2.  Ask questions.\n3.  Do the readings.\n4.  Do the homework and lab.\n5.  Don't procrastinate and don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.\n\n## Learning during a pandemic\n\nI want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from\nthis class. If this requires flexibility, please don't hesitate to ask.\n\n::: incremental\n-   You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or\n    physical) but you're always welcome to talk to me. If I can't help, I\n    likely know someone who can.\n-   I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want\n    you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.\n:::\n\n## This week's tasks\n\n-   Get a GitHub account if you don't have one (some advice for choosing a\n    username\n    [here](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice \"Happy Git with R\"))\n-   Complete the Getting to know you survey if you haven't yet done so!\n-   Read the syllabus\n-   Watch out for next week's announcement email, in your inbox sometime\n    tomorrow\n\n## Midori says...\n\n[![](images/lec-1/midori.jpeg){fig-alt=\"Picture of my cat, Midori, with a speech bubble that says \\\"Read the syllabus and make Mine happy!\\\"\"\nfig-align=\"center\"\nwidth=\"700\"}](https://sta210-s22.github.io/website/course-syllabus.html)\n\n# Application exercise\n\n::: appex\nOr more like demo for today...\n\nüìã\n[github.com/sta210-s22/ae-0-movies](https://github.com/sta210-s22/ae-0-movies)\n:::\n",
